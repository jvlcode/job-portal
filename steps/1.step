Absolutely, let me give you a nice clean summary of all the correct steps we’ve noted so far.

**Section 1: Setting Up the Project**

1. **Create the Main Project Folder**:
   Create a main folder named `jobportal` and navigate into it.

2. **Set Up the React Frontend**:
   Inside the `jobportal` folder, run the command to create a Vite + React project:

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest frontend
   ```

   Follow the prompts: choose "React," "JavaScript," and let it install dependencies automatically.

3. **Check Python and pip**:
   Make sure Python is installed by running `python --version` and ensure `pip` is working by running `pip --version`.

4. **Create a Python Virtual Environment**:
   Set up a virtual environment for the Django backend:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Then activate it:

   * On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   * On Mac/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

5. **Install Django**:
   With the virtual environment activated, install Django using:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install django
   ```

6. **Create the Django Backend**:
   Inside the `jobportal` folder, create the Django project in a folder named `backend`:

   ```bash
   django-admin startproject backend
   ```

7. **Run the Django Development Server**:
   Navigate into the `backend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

   Then run the server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. **Verify the Backend**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to confirm the Django server is running.

And that’s everything we've covered in Section 1. You’ve now got a React frontend and a Django backend both set up and running inside your job portal project. Let me know if there's anything else!
